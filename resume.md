##Myself##
I am a software developer with a special interest in mobile applications and improving user experiences. I chose mobile development as my career because it requires simplicity and the experience can directly affect the user on a daily basis. My brief summary in points is as below:

- I am a mobile developer (iOS/Android) with full development cycle experience from scratch to production including backend services. 
- I have almost 4 years of development experience and most of it is related to mobile application development.
- I am also really interested in learning about all the new and cool stuff in my spare time and try to apply those things to my daily job (the things that are good enough and well tested).

##Things I have worked on##
- I have worked on mobile applications both in iOS and Android using native Objective-C, Java and C# (Xamarin).
- I have worked on high performance, critical backend applications. Slight experience with IBM integration toolkit which gave me really good understanding about the design of micro-services architecture which I use in my development now. 
- I have some experience in writing production backend api services in Node.JS, Python (Django), Java (Play).

##I’m really good at##
- Mobile applications.
- User experiences.
- System design.
- Picking up technical details pretty fast.

##What I’m looking to do next##
- To improve my self and learn new things every day.
- Apply my knowledge of different systems in various ways to the stuff I work on.
- Work on improving people lives one app at a time.
